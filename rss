      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbhZsEpRLMo"></oembed></figure><h2>Tell us a little about yourself, Matthias. Introduce yourself to the world!</h2><p>Hi, my name is Matthias Otto but in these circles everyone calls me Matto! I am Principal level designer at <a href="https://www.crytek.com/" rel="nofollow">Crytek</a> and recently also a very little independent publisher and developer. My level design career got kicked off in 2004 when Crytek released Farcry. A game that shipped with Sandbox, an editor that was intuitive and easy to use. I was buildings maps and mods until I released my last Farcry Mod called <i>Matto4</i> in 2007. I was like 16/17 years old back then and during that process, I had no idea what job I would do in the future. Finally an E-mail arrived from Crytek, offering me an apprentice ship as media designer. This was a fantastic moment solving my issues not knowing what I would do and giving me a big boost in confidence. So 2008 I started at Crytek and was involved in many different games beginning with Crysis 2. I have learned a ton in that time and expanded my knowledge into visual scripting. At some point I was very good at prototyping mechanics which for example led to the VR game <a href="https://www.theclimbgame.com/" rel="nofollow">The Climb</a>. Nowadays I’m on <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/" rel="nofollow">Hunt: Showdown</a> creating unique compounds for the game.</p><figure class="image"><img src="../conv.cryengine.com/Fi_PlNvQ0wbUFkw49dJLl_UxVrNPuM6dfTsJpMcYwwc/el_1/czM6Ly9jcnllbmdpbmUtY29udGVudC9maWxlcy9uZX/dzLzNhMTllMTcyYzA3NDJjNjI5NjJmZjkwM2FkOTg5/YWU4YTJkYzcyZDlkODk5YTg0YjUzNTk2NTV/k3ZWIuanBn.92.delaye" srcset="https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/768/3a19e172c0742c62962ff903ad989ae8a2dc72d9d899a84b5359655f0f0997eb.jpg 768w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/968/3a19e172c0742c62962ff903ad989ae8a2dc72d9d899a84b5359655f0f0997eb.jpg 968w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/1280/3a19e172c0742c62962ff903ad989ae8a2dc72d9d899a84b5359655f0f0997eb.jpg 1280w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/1920/3a19e172c0742c62962ff903ad989ae8a2dc72d9d899a84b5359655f0f0997eb.jpg 1920w" alt="3a19e172c0742c62962ff903ad989ae8a2dc72d9d899a84b5359655f0f0997eb.jpg" /></figure><h2>Congratulations to your release of Spinshot Party! What inspired you to make this game?</h2><p>In summer 2021 I was sitting with friends eating pancakes brainstorming about what little game mechanics I could prototype using multiple gamepads and a single PC screen. During covid I got tired of online games and I was looking for better times in the future where everyone can meetup again and play games in front of a TV like <i>Gang Beasts</i> or <i>Mario party</i>. And then suddenly foosball popped up in the discussion and my brain started working how to control foosball with gamepads. And there it was, a simple mechanic: Use the analog stick to push the rod back and forth and the trigger to spin the Rod. I think I had a first working prototype within a week. And when I was trying and playing that for the first time, I thought this is fun and showed it to other people. It was nice feedback I got from friends and colleagues that was inspiring and encouraging me to continue the development!</p><p> <img src="../conv.cryengine.com/IX73b4kBKlulI9ylfk_Wh7y0Ss9ZgaQSipbe2ax35I0/el_1/czM6Ly9jcnllbmdpbmUtY29udGVudC9maWxlcy9uZX/dzLzVjOWFjNTRhNWJlNDAxYTFlNDJlZmYyMTAxYmU5/MDYxMTIyOTU2Mzk4OTkwYTRiNmZhNmE5MWQ/UwZTIuanBn.94.delaye" srcset="https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/768/5c9ac54a5be401a1e42eff2101be9061122956398990a4b6fa6a91d265f7e0e2.jpg 768w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/968/5c9ac54a5be401a1e42eff2101be9061122956398990a4b6fa6a91d265f7e0e2.jpg 968w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/1280/5c9ac54a5be401a1e42eff2101be9061122956398990a4b6fa6a91d265f7e0e2.jpg 1280w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/1920/5c9ac54a5be401a1e42eff2101be9061122956398990a4b6fa6a91d265f7e0e2.jpg 1920w" alt="5c9ac54a5be401a1e42eff2101be9061122956398990a4b6fa6a91d265f7e0e2.jpg" /></p><h2>You're just one single developer. How did you go about the development process?</h2><p>I like finishing a project. So my goal was to turn the prototype into a game that’s polished enough that I would feel comfortable releasing. I certainly did not aim for perfection, if I would aim for that I would never be finished. So it’s important to say “good is enough”. I knew what parts of the game I could do by myself and where I would need help. Crytek supported me in this process. I got help and support from various disciplines which I cannot thank enough. Talented artists created the unique looking tables, menu visuals, logo concepts and sounds. Those contributions were inspiring and kept me motivated to finally spend lots of my free time to finish the game.</p><h2>What was the most fun part of development?</h2><p>I think most fun was the scripting and crafting of the initial prototype. That moment when I tested the core game mechanic the first time was a great feeling. But I must say I also enjoyed creating high resolution images for the Steam shop, creating and cutting the trailer or tweaking the logo or creating achievements. Those were things I have not really done before and it was fun learning it in the process if making them. And I have to say, it was a great feeling to see my own game pop up in my own Steam library in the end!</p><figure class="image"><img src="../conv.cryengine.com/eTeNf-uM-psHW1ITDRdA5IZTej0eTzgbeDqH0138Z94/el_1/czM6Ly9jcnllbmdpbmUtY29udGVudC9maWxlcy9uZX/dzLzkwN2QxZjE4MjMwYzZhM2JkYjMxNWI4NzEyMmIx/NmYwNDJhZWRmMTg2ODU0NmFjNDI5OGVlNTg/YxMmYuanBn.96.delaye" srcset="https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/768/907d1f18230c6a3bdb315b87122b16f042aedf1868546ac4298ee5804e1c612f.jpg 768w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/968/907d1f18230c6a3bdb315b87122b16f042aedf1868546ac4298ee5804e1c612f.jpg 968w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/1280/907d1f18230c6a3bdb315b87122b16f042aedf1868546ac4298ee5804e1c612f.jpg 1280w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/1920/907d1f18230c6a3bdb315b87122b16f042aedf1868546ac4298ee5804e1c612f.jpg 1920w" alt="907d1f18230c6a3bdb315b87122b16f042aedf1868546ac4298ee5804e1c612f.jpg" /></figure><h2>What's the best thing about Spinshot Party in your opinion?</h2><p>The best thing about the game are the simple and easy to learn controls. Yet I’m aware that controlling the rods properly is not easy at all. If you want to trap the ball, move it to the right position to then kick it into the goal, or do like 45° shots, it’s challenging. If you want to be good at the game you need to learn using the controller in a new way like playing an FPS game with a gamepad for the first time. But the good thing is you can also just wildly spin around the mannequins and something cool will happen in any case, so if your opponent isn't much more skilled than you, the game is still fun to play. So there is something for everyone, and the game is fun right from the start. Easy to learn, hard to master, I would say.</p><h2>Any tips for other developers from your experience?</h2><p>The most important thing in game development is passion. Passion is what keeps you moving and motivated. You should believe in the game idea you are trying to build. And be realistic in what you or your team can achieve. If you have challenges that you don’t exactly know how to tackle, look at them early in the process and use them as stepping stones towardsa a more rounded experience. If you leave the tough parts for later, you risk them becoming roadblocks in your way.</p><figure class="image"><img src="../conv.cryengine.com/Yh0X8LCJqEbfGper9EWFfM5vLrdE6EmtApSDp-u8A94/el_1/czM6Ly9jcnllbmdpbmUtY29udGVudC9maWxlcy9uZX/dzLzQwYzIzNWJkZDU1YmM4YjQ1OWQwMWZiNGI2ZDdj/ODBhNDNjNTRiZTYxNzRiYWYwMjE4MTg3YWI/BkODQuanBn.98.delaye" srcset="https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/768/40c235bdd55bc8b459d01fb4b6d7c80a43c54be6174baf0218187ab41c2a0d84.jpg 768w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/968/40c235bdd55bc8b459d01fb4b6d7c80a43c54be6174baf0218187ab41c2a0d84.jpg 968w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/1280/40c235bdd55bc8b459d01fb4b6d7c80a43c54be6174baf0218187ab41c2a0d84.jpg 1280w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/1920/40c235bdd55bc8b459d01fb4b6d7c80a43c54be6174baf0218187ab41c2a0d84.jpg 1920w" alt="40c235bdd55bc8b459d01fb4b6d7c80a43c54be6174baf0218187ab41c2a0d84.jpg" /></figure><h2>And where can I get Spinshot Party?</h2><p>The game is now available on Steam <a href="https://deu01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2310130%2FSpinshot_Party%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cyakir%40crytek.com%7C7bc2fd7f4b5e49b455b508dbfb1d6610%7C03c747ef499e4234934e0c1a71c0c7ba%7C0%7C0%7C638379875901671410%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=CwmDZCkYGndiv0HUJ0B9fbLa8GXNE%2BAkc2iGhY%2FMZV4%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310130/Spinshot_Party/</a></p><p>Thanks Matto, for your time and insights!

      <description><![CDATA[Public user profile, automatic source code requests and Discord account link are coming to the hub, but the forum will be deprecated.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>CRYENGINE Hub is receiving some cool new updates based on community feedback. The way how online communities interact is constantly changing and more immediate communication methods like Discord are being used in favor over older variants of community spaces like static forums. To adjust our CRYENGINE web presence, we are making some needed changes to the community space. Let’s dive right into it: </p><p><strong>Public User Profile</strong> </p><figure class="image"><img src="../conv.cryengine.com/Vl4NjFJN2QdwFFr29VCLQ4rRgg5ZPzSg0A54NkG4IXE/el_1/czM6Ly9jcnllbmdpbmUtY29udGVudC9maWxlcy9uZX/dzL2RhNDJjNzQ2NjM0NTZjMmYyZjA0ZWNlYTQ2MTYx/MDQ3YzZjMTZjMGFmYjE1MjE0ODlkYWFiYzF/RkZWUucG5n.9a.delaye" srcset="https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/768/da42c74663456c2f2f04ecea46161047c6c16c0afb1521489daabc1ed9bbddee.png 768w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/968/da42c74663456c2f2f04ecea46161047c6c16c0afb1521489daabc1ed9bbddee.png 968w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/1280/da42c74663456c2f2f04ecea46161047c6c16c0afb1521489daabc1ed9bbddee.png 1280w" alt="da42c74663456c2f2f04ecea46161047c6c16c0afb1521489daabc1ed9bbddee.png" /></figure><p> </p><p>CRYENGINE Hub is the centerpoint of the CRYENGINE community alongside our Discord server. To unite developers and give them something to show off, we are enabling the public dashboard for users who want to share their achievements with fellow CryDevs.  </p><p>To set up your new public profile: </p><ul><li>Register or log into CRYENGINE.com on the top left corner of the screen.</li><li>Click on your user icon and choose ‘Dashboard’.</li><li>Choose ‘Public Profile’ on the left-hand-side.</li><li>If you want to make use of your public profile: Start filling out the form with info!</li><li>If you don’t want to make use of your public profile, just leave everything blank.</li></ul><p>At the bottom of this page, you will find an option to enable or disable four profile for public view or just display it to registered and logged in users instead. Users can click on your user name when you comment on our news blog or review assets on the Asset Database and find your public profile, or you can link people to it directly by clicking ‘view profile’ on your dashboard page and share the link. </p><p>Let us know which other cool achievements you would like to share with the world so we can consider them for future updates! </p><p><strong>GitHub Registration Automation</strong> </p><figure class="image"><img src="../conv.cryengine.com/ovRqrYQbFF_k-W_NNa6r3d1gbQdtKQbPvXurFsuj18k/el_1/czM6Ly9jcnllbmdpbmUtY29udGVudC9maWxlcy9uZX/dzL2Q1NTBmMjlkYjM4YjM4YTZhMWE2OTg3ZWViM2Mw/NDNjYTUyMDU1NWMwODRhMzA5NTNlNzA1ZmU/Q2Y2YucG5n.9c.delaye" srcset="https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/768/d550f29db38b38a6a1a6987eeb3c043ca520555c084a30953e705fe1f9d7d6cf.png 768w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/968/d550f29db38b38a6a1a6987eeb3c043ca520555c084a30953e705fe1f9d7d6cf.png 968w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/1280/d550f29db38b38a6a1a6987eeb3c043ca520555c084a30953e705fe1f9d7d6cf.png 1280w" alt="d550f29db38b38a6a1a6987eeb3c043ca520555c084a30953e705fe1f9d7d6cf.png" /></figure><p> </p><p>We know that access to source code is important for the CRYENGINE developer community, and getting it fast can be crucial in the agile world of development. To expedite the process, we have created a way to request source code via your user dashboard.  </p><p>All you have to do is navigate to the user dashboard area at the top right of your CRYENGINE.com account, then request to connect your GitHub account with CRYENGINE 5.7 LTS on GitHub and follow the steps promped to you. And it’s done! Please allow 48 hours for your request to be processed. </p><p><strong>Connecting your Discord Account</strong> </p><figure class="image"><img src="../conv.cryengine.com/Dry1-H_xsJaXXmwKwhkElnpb9ifejh89dWmDgojdCDI/el_1/czM6Ly9jcnllbmdpbmUtY29udGVudC9maWxlcy9uZX/dzLzkwOTJiYTBjOWYzYzc1Y2FiNDE1YzFhNDk4NjFm/ZjZlMzc4YjRhZGI0ZDEyNDc3OTBlMjFiZmI/NhM2YucG5n.9e.delaye" alt="9092ba0c9f3c75cab415c1a49861ff6e378b4adb4d1247790e21bfb0c62bca3f.png" /></figure><p> </p><p>As mentioned before, we see the internet shift towards aile community spaces. Where forums were a crucial place to gather and find information, users actually using static platforms like forums are dwindling according to our data. Therefore, we enable a new feature where CRYENGINE users can connect their Discord account with their CRYENGINE account and appear as Registered Users of CRYENGINE. You can do this in the same way as requesting GitHub access, just click on ‘Discord’ instead in your user dashboard. </p><p><strong>Forum Deprecation</strong> </p><p>As mentioned before, we have seen the numbers of developers actually using the CRYENGINE.com forum dwindling in recent months. We have decided to deprecate the community forums for CRYENGINE and instead focus more on Discord.  </p><p>We had good times with the CRYENGINE forum, but the php.bb platform is outdated and keeping it up takes time we would rather invest into other endeavors for the community. <strong>The forum will be turned offline after a grace period of two weeks after this post. </strong> </p><p>All links to the public forum have been removed from CRYENGINE.com as of today, but if there is any information you would still like to review, save or change on the good old forum, you can do that through <a href="https://forum.cryengine.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">this link</a>. </p><p>Are your ready to register your latest CRYENGINE project? Let us know about it via the new and improved Game Registration page on the CRYENGINE Launcher, and share news about your game with the community in the comments or via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cryengineofficial/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cryengine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">X</a>.

      <description><![CDATA[Find out how to make great game trailers with insight from Crytek's Director of Creative and Cinematic Services.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The latest installment in our Game Dev Tips &amp; Tricks series is filled with invaluable insight about how to create awesome game trailers. A game trailer is your most important marketing asset and, very often, the first time your potential audience sees your game. First impressions count, and your trailer can make or break interest in your game. Today, we're delighted to be joined by Philip Roberts, Crytek's Director of Creative and Cinematic Services, who has led the creation of over 700 trailers during his career in games! Philip oversees the production of cinematic scenes and video game trailers across Crytek's games, and these tips will help you make sure your trailer lands with a splash! </p><p><strong>Three Tips for Creating Great Game Trailers</strong></p><p><strong>Think about the message!</strong></p><p>A trailer is a sales tool and your most valuable one. It’s often the first time a potential player sees your game in action. A great trailer can raise awareness of your game and create online discussions, hopefully spreading the good word. So, consider what you want to say and its purpose at the beginning of any trailer project. Do you want to create an announcement trailer telling the world about the game for the first time? Or a feature trailer focusing on a single aspect of your game, such as a new DLC or gameplay mechanic? Or do you want to get the engaging elements of the story across? Once you know your core message and purpose, it’s important to keep this in mind throughout the whole process to create a well-focused marketing asset. Whatever you decide, your trailer should allow the audience to easily understand what type of game it is, for instance, FPS, RPG, or RTS, and if it is single-player or has co-op or multiplayer modes. Most importantly of all, make sure you leave them wanting to play it!</p><p><strong>Consider narrative and structure</strong></p><p>Generally, viewers will watch the first ten seconds of your trailer if they have stumbled across it or are viewing it out of curiosity. Beyond that, nothing is guaranteed. So don't waste time on logos or messaging slates at the start of your trailer. Present them with your best footage up front and show them what is unique about your game. Try and include a narrative hook that will keep them interested in watching more of the trailer. Viewer retention for a full trailer is a tricky thing to achieve, so thinking about narrative, pacing, and structure will improve your chances. The narrative of the trailer doesn't have to be story-driven, although it can be. It is more about the pace and flow of the shots. Try grouping similar elements together and always end your trailer with a call to action, so the viewer knows where to find out more about your game, when it is coming out, and the platforms it will be on.</p><p><strong>Quality over quantity!</strong></p><p>When someone sees a small black dot on a white sheet of paper, they fail to see the big picture, the almost pure white sheet of paper. Their eyes are instead drawn to the imperfection, the black dot. It’s always tempting for first-time trailer makers to show everything about their game in a trailer, but if a feature in your game is not ready or not that important or interesting, then don't show it. Trailers are your opportunity to show your game at its best, so focus on doing just that. Don't be forced into feeling you must fill a certain amount of time for your trailer or throw the kitchen sink at it. Typically, there are no rules on a trailer's length, and very often, less is more. So go for quality over quantity and show well-focused footage that delivers your messaging and leaves the viewer wanting more!  </p><p>You can check out some of our incredibly talented Creative Service Team’s work on Hunt: Showdown for further inspiration below:</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=803IUEgOBfE"></oembed></figure><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vy1Dp4A7ps"></oembed></figure><p>Want more game dev tips?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Today’s installment in our Game Dev Tips &amp; Tricks series will be helpful for anyone involved in the business of making games. Learn how to pitch your game to publishers, find your game’s audience, and pick up practical tips and tricks for marketing with invaluable advice from Gabriel Yakir Ketteler, Senior Manager for CRYENGINE Ecosystem &amp; Communication, who has been there, done it, and got the t-shirt!</p><figure class="image"><img src="../conv.cryengine.com/yamixXtiS9tDyb22BOHY39VJmyvG5RPtv5Dg2mvTja4/el_1/czM6Ly9jcnllbmdpbmUtY29udGVudC9maWxlcy9uZX/dzLzgyYjY0NDA4ODBkZmI3MmFmNTQxMGU1NmQzNDYy/NDNiNDBkMmE3NDY5NjA0NWFhZTAzODdkMWU/czOTMuanBn.a4.delaye" srcset="https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/768/82b6440880dfb72af5410e56d346243b40d2a74696045aae0387d1e5e8f07393.jpg 768w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/968/82b6440880dfb72af5410e56d346243b40d2a74696045aae0387d1e5e8f07393.jpg 968w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/1280/82b6440880dfb72af5410e56d346243b40d2a74696045aae0387d1e5e8f07393.jpg 1280w" alt="82b6440880dfb72af5410e56d346243b40d2a74696045aae0387d1e5e8f07393.jpg" /></figure><p><strong>Three Tips for Marketing Your Game</strong></p><p><strong>Think about marketing early!</strong></p><p>You should think about marketing your game at the very beginning of development, at least if commercializing your game is your goal. There’s nothing wrong with creating a passion project for free using a platform like <a href="https://itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">itch.io</a>. But with the sheer number of games to play and the countless new releases, remakes, and sales, it is becoming increasingly challenging to cut through the noise and reach the right audience for your game. That often has nothing to do with how good your game is!</p><p>So, think about the target audience for your game the moment you write down the first ideas for the project. And evaluate the unique selling point or USP of your game. This will be crucial to your game's success. You should also familiarize yourself with your competitors. Look at other studios and their past and present releases that overlap with your game in genre, mood, art style, budget, and even difficulty. </p><p>Then ask yourself: What sets my game apart from other games? Why would I play this game if it wasn't mine? And ask your friends and family about your ideas, demanding honest answers! Keep in mind that not everyone will be supportive of your vision - and that's ok. Making a game that pleases everyone is almost impossible, and trying to do so will set you up for failure. Do all of this before you have spent a lot of time prototyping or making your game, or you will find it harder to let go of already conceived ideas and run the risk of overexerting yourself with unnecessary fluff and details. Do yourself a favor and ask the important questions before you even start prototyping.</p><p><strong>Engage potential players online</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, the days of entirely free marketing are over, and you’ll have to spend some cash here and there. But even with a small budget, there's plenty you can do. Start building a community around your game early on big platforms like Steam or the Epic Game Store. They usually come with forums or some other kind of engagement platform, and this is where your first players will be.</p><p>If you want to start even sooner, use social media to attract an audience of dedicated super fans early on. They will be your ambassadors and help you carry the torch once you're ready to enter the arena. <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Discord</a> is a great and mostly free tool where you can create a server for your community to gather around the virtual campfire and talk about your game. Those are the good folks who can also help you test your game. Community management is the Alpha and the Omega - small-budget games and large-budget productions are nothing without a dedicated community of supporters, so treat them well.</p><p>One thing that has become increasingly difficult to handle recently is crowdfunding. It is still advisable to look into monetizing your community to help build your game but be careful about investing too much in that too early on. It's not the holy grail it once was. </p><p>Platforms like <a href="https://deu01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patreon.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cpeterw_E%40crytek.com%7C7d7acdc6d1364416f4e108db50a02e4e%7C03c747ef499e4234934e0c1a71c0c7ba%7C0%7C0%7C638192421120506303%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=Katu773N75e17C%2B7sMExL0OcdtYJr4pkjHXSWdD40gs%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a>, <a href="https://deu01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2F%3Fref%3Dnav&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cpeterw_E%40crytek.com%7C7d7acdc6d1364416f4e108db50a02e4e%7C03c747ef499e4234934e0c1a71c0c7ba%7C0%7C0%7C638192421120506303%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=wFAK0KVkRpZ%2FCVmT6%2BPc6PDkURjmMvFfpB%2FfbCO3mzo%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Kickstarter</a>, and <a href="https://deu01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cpeterw_E%40crytek.com%7C7d7acdc6d1364416f4e108db50a02e4e%7C03c747ef499e4234934e0c1a71c0c7ba%7C0%7C0%7C638192421120506303%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=HLo34kqJciNhVKC0MHx45AZ8lDwS6xmXkDYs8VUDKRA%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">IndieGoGO</a> or even smaller-scale donation pages like <a href="https://deu01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cpeterw_E%40crytek.com%7C7d7acdc6d1364416f4e108db50a02e4e%7C03c747ef499e4234934e0c1a71c0c7ba%7C0%7C0%7C638192421120506303%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=pWX%2BHY89ynREHsD%2BjvffDUSvk9sekmS4pcP8dB3LP7A%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">KoFi</a> are nice to have, but your supporters will expect bang for their buck. Don't fall down the rabbit hole of entangling yourself in monetized expectation management - if you ask people for money, you need to deliver. And asking for regular donations, like on Patreon, for example, puts a lot of pressure on your side to keep delivering constant content and news exclusive for Patrons, which can distract you from working on your actual game and using any additional content to promote it freely. </p><p>If you shackle yourself to an additional content pipeline of assets and items worth your supporter's money that you cannot share outside of your already established circle of supporters, that will slow down your effort in broadcasting your game to a wider audience. You would also need a solid roadmap detailing your resources at least 12 months in advance to make that route smooth sailing. </p><p>Of course, crowdfunding is also a source of income. So if you choose that route, don't forget to check the licensing documents of the engine and tools you use when you start crowdfunding. In some cases, making cash with your game even before release can mean you owe money to the publisher of the software you use. And, of course, check your country's tax regulations too!</p><p><strong>Refine your pitch and pitch to the right people</strong></p><p>Pitching to a publisher is an art in and of itself. It’s important to look for the right publisher. Publishers have a catalog, and your game needs to fit right in, so checking out the publisher landscape before you start fleshing out your initial idea will save you a lot of trouble. And you shouldn't be wasting a publisher's time, ever. It can get you blacklisted, so make sure you do your homework, pitch your game to the right publisher with similar games in their portfolio, and don't start pitchin' before you have the following things:</p><ul><li>A Game Design Document</li><li>Concept Art &amp; Designs that are solid enough to speak volumes about the finished product</li><li>Ideally, a vertical slice that shows the core gameplay loop. This can be whitebox or use prototype assets</li><li>Make sure your Core Gameplay loop shows your USP</li></ul><p>Everything should be digestible in 20 to 30 minutes. That doesn't mean you have 30 minutes to explain your game- you should be able to explain it in 10! When you have their attention, they'll give you ample time to show and tell more. But to even get to that point, make sure you can fit your best arguments for your game on one spacious presentation slide. And always remember to be receptive to feedback and be respectful. Games are big business, but it's a small industry. You don't have to take all the advice you might be given but thank people for giving it anyway, as long as it is provided in good faith.</p><p>If you want more advice, you can chat with Gabriel directly on the official <a href="https://deu01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fcryengine&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cpeterw_E%40crytek.com%7C7d7acdc6d1364416f4e108db50a02e4e%7C03c747ef499e4234934e0c1a71c0c7ba%7C0%7C0%7C638192421120662528%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=sIVf3f0%2BcxBfWlwxyjmKq5h3PjwpwFt0X0Piz8EfCyE%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CRYENGINE Discord</a>, the home of our friendly and experienced CRYENGINE community.

      <description><![CDATA[We recently hosted a studio tour to inspire the next generation of female game developers!]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>CRYENGINE and Crytek were proud to participate in <a href="https://www.girls-day.de/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Girls' Day 2023</a>, a day of action in Germany intended to increase the proportion of female employees in fields that have been considered "men's jobs" in the past. Women across all departments make outstanding contributions to the production of CRYENGINE and Crytek’s games, and by participating in this event, we hope to encourage the next generation to follow in their footsteps.</p><p>In total, we welcomed 15 young girls with an average age of 12 to Crytek to learn more about game development and take a tour of the studio. The day included an introduction to how Crytek operates on a day-to-day basis and how different departments and roles contribute to game development by Gabriel Ketteler, Sr Manager for CRYENGINE Ecosystem &amp; Communication, and Ronja Hoth, Learning &amp; Development Specialist for HR.</p><figure class="image"><img src="../conv.cryengine.com/OcTS3xzg8U66iZdXosVRA_6_0K2qK7ENJKzY4mYj3ko/el_1/czM6Ly9jcnllbmdpbmUtY29udGVudC9maWxlcy9uZX/dzLzE1Nzg4NDg5YzYwZDI2NDIwMWI2OWU3NzhiNGI2/MWQ5M2U2ZTZlMzE4YzU1NjZjM2Y2M2YxMzE/lmZWEuanBn.a6.delaye" srcset="https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/768/15788489c60d264201b69e778b4b61d93e6e6e318c5566c3f63f1319b8509fea.jpg 768w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/968/15788489c60d264201b69e778b4b61d93e6e6e318c5566c3f63f1319b8509fea.jpg 968w" alt="15788489c60d264201b69e778b4b61d93e6e6e318c5566c3f63f1319b8509fea.jpg" /></figure><p>Based on their individual interests, the kids spent 30 minutes with different members of staff to shadow their work. They spent time with Franziska Siebert, Graphic Designer for Marketing, Julia Weigel, Technical Artist for Hunt: Showdown, Saskia Schneising, Junior Technical Artist for Hunt: Showdown, and one of our VFX Artists for Crysis 4 (Working title.)</p><p>The kids also enjoyed a session where they were introduced to game programming, level design, and game production and then completed a short hands-on task set by Junior Evangelist for CRYENGINE, Roman Perezogin. Additional staff helping the kids build a game were Jan Hellwig, Lead Systems Programmer for Hunt: Showdown, and Nicole Gransitzki, Product Manager for CRYENGINE Tools. This session proved very popular, and many of the participants didn’t want to stop working on the tasks! The day finished with a Q&amp;A session with members of our team and certificates for their participation.</p><p>Slots for this year were booked out immediately, but we hope to welcome more girls to the studio next year as part of the initiative. Interested parents, teachers, and girls can learn more by visiting <a href="https://www.girls-day.de/ueber-den-girls-day/was-ist-der-girls-day2/english" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">https://www.girls-day.de</a>. A survey saw each of the girls award their day the official top score of “very good,” and six of the girls who came along said they had found their dream career during the tour! But it wasn’t just a great day for the girls involved. Members of the Crytek team gave their thoughts on the day as well:</p><figure class="image"><img src="../conv.cryengine.com/daTdy6p30_BAlzQMmW4dlJrLXcIEAraDTkIuwDOyfiY/el_1/czM6Ly9jcnllbmdpbmUtY29udGVudC9maWxlcy9uZX/dzL2JkODcwZmRjNjU4YmNlM2U3Y2NmN2I0ZWM1YzY5/ZDY5OTBlNDFkZGNkMGE1MzM3MmI2ZjFkNmU/IwZDEuanBn.a8.delaye" srcset="https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/768/bd870fdc658bce3e7ccf7b4ec5c69d6990e41ddcd0a53372b6f1d6e5fe5f20d1.jpg 768w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/968/bd870fdc658bce3e7ccf7b4ec5c69d6990e41ddcd0a53372b6f1d6e5fe5f20d1.jpg 968w" alt="bd870fdc658bce3e7ccf7b4ec5c69d6990e41ddcd0a53372b6f1d6e5fe5f20d1.jpg" /></figure><p>Ronja Hoth, Junior Learning &amp; Development Specialist for Crytek HR, said:</p><p>“It was really lovely to welcome the girls to our studio and give them a taste of the gaming industry. The girls were super-interested throughout, and some didn't want to stop doing the hands-on tasks, which was very inspiring! The thought that we could encourage more women to become part of the gaming industry through Girls' Day is excellent, and we hope to see some of the girls in the studio again as team members in the future!”</p><figure class="image"><img src="../conv.cryengine.com/GPEfYK-yE_xmjPfSHmXTaJQ8rY8dBpbGgvm2Q3jWPS8/el_1/czM6Ly9jcnllbmdpbmUtY29udGVudC9maWxlcy9uZX/dzLzFmZTY5ZTYzYTdkNDU1ZjBlZTMwMDcwYWM0Nzk5/ZTRiMTA4ODFhNDlkNGZlY2E2MzUxNDcwNTM/M2ZjkuanBn.aa.delaye" srcset="https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/768/1fe69e63a7d455f0ee30070ac4799e4b10881a49d4feca6351470538abd236f9.jpg 768w, https://www.cryengine.com/files/news/968/1fe69e63a7d455f0ee30070ac4799e4b10881a49d4feca6351470538abd236f9.jpg 968w" alt="1fe69e63a7d455f0ee30070ac4799e4b10881a49d4feca6351470538abd236f9.jpg" /></figure><p>Gabriel Yakir Ketteler,<strong> </strong>Senior Manager for CRYENGINE, said:</p><p> “I am overjoyed that we were able to participate in Girls' Day. Seeing all these bright young spirits shine during the studio visit was inspirational. All the girls enjoyed the presentations and excelled in the hands-on tasks. The game modding and coding challenges proved popular as the rigging, particle effects, and graphic design examples we prepared.

What are the core pillars of the game? And from there, what elements can you put in the level to serve them? Ask yourself where this particular level fits in the game. Is it a tutorial level where you need to teach the player certain things? How skilled should they be at the point of the game they are playing through this level? And, of course, is there a story and theme to the game? What are the story beats that need to be included, and what should the atmosphere be? This will help guide you when you begin the process and will assist you when you think about the pacing of the level."</p><p><strong>Block out your level</strong></p><p>"When you have decided what you want to achieve, I recommend reference gathering. Whatever your location is, search for imagery on the web for inspiration. If you're working as part of a wider team, speak to your concept artists, who should also be able to provide you with concepts, and then talk through those concepts with them. When you have devoured and discussed the imagery, get your pens out. Begin with 2D sketches of your level spaces, a quick way to visualize your concept. Then when you have a good outline, start blocking the level out in-engine to get a 3D feel for your level. When you have your level blocked out, review it to check that all your game mechanics are, or can be, implemented. You also need to ensure that it aligns with the principles established at the start of the process, like the game's core pillars and how it serves the players."</p><p><strong>Gather feedback!</strong></p><p>Once your level is blocked out and you have completed your own review, show and play through your level with as many people as possible. Of course, if you're in a team, you'll get important feedback from artists, fellow level designers, and other colleagues. But don't be afraid to show your workings to non-developers, too. Some of the most important feedback you can get is from potential players. You'll gain valuable insights about your concept and how players actually play the level from people with little or no knowledge of your project. Collect feedback from all players afterwards, but also watch them play in real time if you can, and take notes. Do players find their way through the level successfully? Do they get lost? Are there choke points, and is the pacing right? Collate all of the feedback and implement solutions that align with the game's core pillars, the concept of the level, and what you want to achieve. Then rinse and repeat to take your level to final!"</p><p>Thanks to Matthias for providing advice drawn from years of experience working on award-winning games.

      <title><![CDATA[Game Design Tips & Tricks: Visual Effects]]></title>
      <link>https://www.cryengine.com/news/view/game-design-tips-tricks-visual-effects</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Learn best practices for creating visual effects with the latest installment in our Game Dev Tips series]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Creating a game, whether as a one-person indie outfit or as part of a wider team, draws upon a range of technical and creative talents from across many disciplines. Today we’re presenting some top tips on creating visual effects with proven-in-production advice from Viktor Ikkes, Senior VFX Artist for Hunt Showdown and an industry leader in the field.</p><p><strong>Three Tips for Creating Particle Effects in Games</strong></p><p><strong>Effects must deliver a message</strong></p><p>“All visual effects in your game must deliver a message, so think about that at the start of the process. Some effects may be ambient, for instance, rainfall. They simply need to convey a certain mood, which is an artistic challenge in itself. But gameplay effects need to be readable and represent what is happening from a gameplay perspective, so you need to understand what the requirements are before you start. For instance, if you have a magical effect where a character absorbs a healing essence from another character, you want to really understand the game mechanics and the message that needs to be conveyed to the player. That will play into different considerations. Where does the health come from on the enemy character? Where does it enter the player's character? How fast does it go? Define these elements as your starting point to convey what is happening to the player as you begin to think about the effect.”</p><p><strong>Use reference to guide you</strong></p><p>“If possible, try to look at real-life references for what you are making. Try to get a “feel” for the effects and find the components that make the effect up. Most visual effects are based on something from real life, even if you are making something magical or abstract. For instance, if you want to create a fire-based effect for a character, you should check out how fire moves, the shapes it makes, how quickly it moves, and so on. Mostly, you’ll want to look at video references. Photos are fine, but motion is important. Ideally, you can check out something in the real world. Let’s say we want to make a water-based visual effect. If you can, observe a river in real life. Look at the wave behavior, color, and motion. Then think about what will make your particle feel like water, even if it’s an abstract effect. Imagine you wanted to make a waterfall. You might want to consider its multiple components – how the water splashes, the mist that appears, how the water flows down, how individual drops behave, and so on. Break your reference down into components and work out the components you need to get the required effect.”</p><p><strong>Test and keep it simple</strong></p><p>“Once you have your overall picture and components, like timing, shapes, and colors, you’ll want to get all those components together in a particle and place it in a level. This is an excellent time to discover other elements you need, those you don’t, and what is working or not. Taking the example of a waterfall, testing is an excellent time to see how the mist scatters with light. Find out how the refraction works and if you need to make changes. Then consider other elements about the waterfall – does a player need to pass through it, interact with it, or will it be a background asset? If it’s a background asset and a player can’t interact with it, design towards that and don’t over-complicate it. Remember, there are no points for over-engineering, so keep your things as simple as it needs to be. Work quickly and smart, which is good advice for whatever you do in game dev!</p><p>“Another thing you may wish to consider is making it easy for others to use. Often, you will want to give other people on your dev team control over elements of the asset. For instance, you might wish to expose color to them. But when you do that, think about only exposing those colors that you feel will be appropriate within the artistic vision. Make variables available and easy to use but not easy to misuse.”           </p><p>Big thanks to Viktor for taking the time to compile some of his top tips for visual effect creation. Go further by checking out a couple of episodes from our CRYENGINE Breeze Academy series, where Viktor presents more yet more invaluable practical advice for creating visual effects.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X43CaHwFlg&amp;list=PLpCgy91Y5vMtp5OQPP9Sq-1JfJhVVquEs&amp;index=14"></oembed></figure><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKeSAdttFW4&amp;list=PLpCgy91Y5vMtp5OQPP9Sq-1JfJhVVquEs&amp;index=15"></oembed></figure><p>Are you making something cool with CRYENGINE?

      <description><![CDATA[Need inspiration for how to approach narrative in your game? Watch a talk from Hunt: Showdown writers and pick up some top tips.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Creating a game, whether as a one-person indie outfit or as part of a wider team, draws upon a range of technical and creative talents from across many disciplines. Today we’re bringing you some top tips derived from a talk from Crytek’s very own Senior Narrative Designer Bárbara Framil and Narrative Designer Bri Williams, which was given towards the end of last year at the Games Industry Conference in Poland, one of the largest game developer events in Europe. You can check out the full talk below.</p><p>Both Bárbara and Bri work on Hunt: Showdown, which is soon to celebrate its landmark fifth anniversary, and other projects, including the Crysis franchise. The wide-ranging talk is called “The Hunter’s Journey: Narrative Design for Live Games” and lasts around an hour. The discussion includes case studies from Hunt: Showdown and gives helpful advice for anybody putting story into their games, whether it’s a live game or not. You can watch the entire talk below, but we've pulled together a few tips inspired by the stream which will be valuable whether you’re starting out with narrative or looking to expand the content once you’ve shipped.</p><p><strong>Three Tips for Narrative Design in Games</strong></p><p><strong>1.Backstories bring your character to life</strong></p><p>Think about your characters, where they come from, what their motivations are, and how that affects their role in your game. This can guide their design and how they act in your world and provides fertile ground for yet more engaging content. Those backstories aren’t always revealed to players, but elements will be. For example, in Hunt, Hunters may have just a two or three-sentence description describing who they are and the weapons they bring to the game, which players can read to give them the minimum of what they need to understand. But beyond that, players can also check out a short two or three paragraphs which describe their story, how they came to the game world, and the reasons behind their weapons. These are still short entries, but they represent a lot of hard work behind the scenes, making them feel more natural within the context of the game and the story. And by offering up more lore for players who want to discover it, you can offer a more engaging experience.</p><p>A good way to start is to think about what the characters mean and what they represent to the player. In Hunt, the team wants you to become attached to your Hunters, and feel a sense of loss when you lose them, so they are fleshed out as “real” people with their own desires and events that have shaped them. Inspiration can come from anywhere. For instance, much of the inspiration for Hunt’s Legendary Hunter, Daughter of Decay, came from Celtic culture. But all the details and motivations are grounded in the context of the game’s world. Whether you explain much about your characters in your game to the player or not, establishing backstories for core characters will help define their actions and make them feel more ‘real’ in your game world.</p><p><strong>2.Story doesn’t have to be limited to the core plot</strong></p><p>Immersing players in your game isn’t just about the action or the main story. Use your game’s setting as a starting point to flesh out a rich world. In Hunt, you can learn more about the game and stories within the world from all kinds of elements, from wanted posters around the Bayou to book entries to transmedia content like blogs and Twitter stories. The core game loop in Hunt keeps players battling through round after round, but the approach in Hunt has been to add all kinds of optional content for players to enjoy, and for those players who do, you can create a more engaging experience. Make your world feel richer and deeper and offer fans more ways to experience the lore of your game by building story elements into game objects and other contact points with your game. This can give further context about the action in your game and your player's experiences in it.</p><p><strong>3.Subvert expectations</strong></p><p>In Hunt Showdown, you usually play with a specific Hunter each time. For the Serpent Moon live event, a new approach was taken to narrative for the protagonist, Legendary Hunter Viper. The Viper was the first character to evolve through the event, with four different levels of progression. This required a different approach, as in Hunt, you are typically rewarded with a new character for your actions in the game. To add a level of mystery and desire for progression, the usual description of the character was withheld from the start. Instead, as the player progresses through each stage, art and animation was a key to expressing The Viper’s motivation and story arc, with the character developing from a reasonably plain character at the beginning to a very strong, confident, and assured Legendary Hunter by the end.</p><p>The mystery at the start of the character’s introduction compared to the usual way characters are introduced, combined with unique visual storytelling(we’ll avoid spoilers here, just in case), provided a brand new experience and a satisfying story arc that proved a hit with players. You can play with your own established norms in your games by setting a particular narrative style and then using different methods for story elements. Just make sure you ground it all within the wider context of your game.</p><p>Check out the full talk below for more insights about storytelling in Hunt and pick up further tips that could be applied to approaching your own game’s narrative.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCu65L1P6mE"></oembed></figure><p>Are you telling stories with CRYENGINE?

      <description><![CDATA[Refine your code and allow your players to crouch by watching the latest in our CRYENGINE 5.7 LTS C++ tutorial series!]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The next installment in our CRYENGINE 5.7 LTS tutorial series shows you how to add a crouch mechanic to a player-controlled character using C++. You'll also learn how to refine the code you've created so far in the series to provide a solid basis for the future, which is good practice for any project. Your host, as ever, is Technical Author and Video Producer Nick Gillin.</p><p>The tutorial builds on the previous episodes in the series. The first shows you how to create a player-controlled character from scratch with traditional WASD movement and mouse-look functionality. The second shows you how to add a sprinting mechanic, and the third episode shows you how to add jumping. By completing those tutorials, you will gain a grounding in C++ and produce the file required to complete this new course.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/63PuJoVoQMg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Episode 1 – Create a player character with C++</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWExyPNIW30" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Episode 2 – Create player walking and sprinting mechanics in C++</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85hiBjsGClI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Episode 3 – Add a jump mechanic to your player character</a></p><p>In the new episode, Nick begins by refining the existing code established in the previous tutorials. This process will include modifications to make it easier to work with as the project grows in complexity and is best practice for any game project. Once the code is refined, you will be shown how to go over the code to integrate functions and components that will add a crouching input for the player. Once the process of adding a crouch mechanic to the player is completed, you will have a player-controlled character capable of walking, running, jumping, and crouching!</p><p>You can also follow along or complete the tutorial using <a href="https://docs.cryengine.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=106627474" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">our written documentation</a>.</p><figure class="media"><oembed url="https://youtu.be/H8U8UU0Y1m8%5D"></oembed></figure><p>Don't forget to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/cryengine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">official YouTube channel</a>, home to a wide range of learning videos, to get a notification when the next one drops.</p><p>If you have questions or feedback about CRYENGINE, let us know in the comments, on the <a href="https://forum.cryengine.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">forum</a>, or via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cryengineofficial/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cryengine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>.
